     npx cypress open
     ```
   - This will open the Cypress test runner in your browser. You can then run the tests interactively.

6. **Code Quality and Linting**:
   - The project uses **ESLint** to ensure the code quality and **Prettier** for formatting.
     - To check code quality with ESLint:
       ```bash
       npm run lint
